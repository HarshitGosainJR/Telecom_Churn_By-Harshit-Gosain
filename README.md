# Telecom_Churn_By-Harshit-Gosain
This project predicts customer churn in the telecom industry by analyzing customer data. The goal is to identify high-risk customers and key churn indicators to help telecom companies retain profitable clients.

Steps
Data Reading & Cleaning: Import and clean the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore data patterns, including churn rates.
Model Building: Evaluate models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
Feature Engineering & Tuning: Refine features and tune models.
Model Evaluation: Measure model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
Conclusion: Identify key churn indicators and finalize the best model.
Key Insights
92% of customers are non-churn, and 8% churn.
Key churn indicators: low revenue, high call usage, significant recharge discrepancies, and roaming behavior.
Best Model: Random Forest with Precision ~59%, Recall ~65%, F1-score ~61%.
